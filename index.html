                <br> <br>
                Hoover Dam, formerly called Boulder Dam, dam in Black Canyon on the Colorado River, at the
                Arizona-Nevada border, U.S. Constructed between 1930 and 1936, it is the highest concrete arch dam in
                the
                United States. It impounds Lake Mead, which extends for 115 miles (185 km) upstream and is one of the
                largest artificial lakes in the world. The dam is used for flood and silt control, hydroelectric power,
                agricultural irrigation, and domestic water supply. It is also a major sightseeing destination, with
                some
                seven million visitors a year, almost one million of whom go on tours through the dam.

                Hoover Dam is 726 feet (221 metres) high and 1,244 feet (379 metres) long at the crest. It contains
                4,400,000 cubic yards (3,360,000 cubic metres) of concrete. Four reinforced-concrete intake towers
                located
                above the dam divert water from the reservoir into huge steel pipes called penstocks. The water, after
                falling some 500 feet (150 metres) through the pipes to a hydroelectric power plant in the base of the
                dam,
                turns 17 Francis-type vertical hydraulic turbines, which rotate a series of electric generators that
                have a
                total power capacity of 2,080 megawatts. Nearly half of the generated electric power goes to the
                Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the city of Los Angeles, and other destinations in
                southern California; the rest goes to Nevada and Arizona. The dam, power plant, and reservoir are owned
                and
                managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation.

                <h2> Description of Adam's Bridge:</h2>
                <br>
                Adam’s Bridge, also called Rama’s Bridge, chain of shoals, between the islands of Mannar, near
                northwestern Sri Lanka, and Rāmeswaram, off the southeastern coast of India. The bridge is 30 miles (48
                km) long and separates the Gulf of Mannar (southwest) from the Palk Strait (northeast). Some of the
                sandbanks are dry, and nowhere are the shoals deeper than 4 feet (1 m); thus, they seriously hinder
                navigation. Dredging operations, now abandoned, were begun as early as 1838 but never succeeded in
                maintaining a channel for any vessels except those of light draft. Geologic evidence suggests that
                Adam’s Bridge represents a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka. Traditionally, it is said
                to be the remnant of a huge causeway constructed by Rāma, the hero of the Hindu epic Rāmāyaṇa, to
                facilitate the passage of his army from India to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) for the rescue of his abducted wife,
                Sītā. According to Muslim legend, Adam crossed there to Adam’s Peak, Ceylon, atop which he stood
                repentant on one foot for 1,000 years.

                <h2> Description of McDermott's Castle</h2>
                <br> <br>
                As you can see from the photo above, it’s quite literally plonked on a little green island smack bang in
                the
                middle of a lake.

                Although McDermott’s Castle gets far less attention than the likes of the most haunted castle in Ireland
                and
                Blarney Castle, it’s still well worth a visit.

                In the guide below, you’ll find out everything that you need to know about this incredible
                fairytale-like
                castle.

                You’ll find McDermott’s Castle in County Roscommon on Lough Key, 3km northeast of the town of Boyle.

                Stretching around 10km across and forming a rough circular shape, Lough Key contains over 30 islands
                scattered throughout its chilly waters.

                One of these islands is aptly named ‘Castle Island’ and it’s here that you’ll find the ruins of
                McDermott’s
                Castle.
